    75. Sort Colors Medium

    Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue,
    sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are
    adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

    Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent
    the color red, white, and blue respectively.

    Note: You are not suppose to use the library's sort
    function for this problem.
